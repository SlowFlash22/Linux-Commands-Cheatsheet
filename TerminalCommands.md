`sudo shutdown -h <time> "Message"`
- To find the address of an installed program: `which <app>` or `whereis <app>`

>    *For example:<br/>
touch -d "2010-01-02 00:01:00" xyz.txt<br/>
touch -t 201001020001.00 xyz.txt<br/>
Both the above commands create a text file "xyz.txt" with creation date as 02-January-2010 at 12:01 a.m.*

        - Example(both ways do the same thing):
            - echo message 1 > myfile<br/>echo message 2 >> myfile<br/>echo message 3 >> myfile
            - cat << EOF > myfile<br/>> message 1</br>> message 2<br/>> message 3<br/>> EOF

- Three types of loops are often used in most programming languages:
    - `for` loop:<br />
        for variable-name in list<br />
        do<br />
        &emsp;execute one iteration for each item in the list until the list is finished<br />
